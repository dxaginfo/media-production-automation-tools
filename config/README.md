# Configuration Directory

This directory contains configuration templates and examples for all tools in the collection.

## Structure

- Each tool has its own configuration subdirectory
- Templates are provided in both YAML and JSON formats
- Example configurations for common use cases are included
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, production)

## Configuration Best Practices

1. Never store sensitive information (API keys, passwords) in configuration files
2. Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Include comments in configuration files to explain options
4. Use version control for configuration templates, but not for environment-specific configurations
5. Validate configurations before deployment

## Common Configuration Parameters

- API endpoints
- Input/output directories
- Default parameters
- Logging levels
- Performance settings
